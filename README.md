## **Overview**

#### *Description*
An application that helps users find conventions for special interests and hobbies (i.e. Anime, Video Games, Sci-Fi, etc.), with the added ability to *connect* and meet new people while attending a convention. The application will list several conventions based on the user's location and will include a search/sort feature to allow them to find conventions based on their interests. Furthermore, each individual convetion lisitng will contain relavent information about the con and will include a link to their respective official website.

#### *App Evaluation*
- **Category:** Social Networking/Event Tracking
- **Story:** Users are able to search for either local or domestic conventions for specific interest and hobbies (i.e. Anime, Gaming, Sci-Fi/Fantasy, etc.)
- **Market:** The products initial user base are those interested in Geek/Nerd Culture, but it will grow to a casual audience to those who enjoy or are interested in attending a convention
- **Habit:** The app can be used at any time of the year, as there would be consistent updates for conventions happening during the year and future con dates in case a user wants to plan a con visit in advance.
- **Scope:** The starting point would be the creation of a user profile and selecting various interests to create a short list of conventions matching the user's interests. The next part would be setting up the search/sort feature to give the user a wide range of convetions within their home state or in other states.
